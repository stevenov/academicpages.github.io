I'm an academic librarian and writer, focusing on everything from library issues to free and open software to music.

I'm Professor/Acting Chief Librarian at LaGuardia Community College. My academic work centers, broadly, around technology, but has recently begun to focus on collections. My first book, *The Librarian's Guide to Academic Research in the Cloud,* showed readers how to use technology to make research easier and more effective. I'm also a certified Project Management Professional (PMP).

I also write about technology for wider audiences, concentrating on free and open source software. [The Linux Setup](https://linuxrig.com/the-linux-setup/) is my collection of interviews with desktop Linux users about their Linux setups. My book, *[Learn Linux in a Month of Lunches](http://manning.com/ovadia)*, teaches non-technical users how to use Linux for everyday tasks.

I recently returned to music writing, reviewing albums and interviewing artists across genres, but concentrating on blues and Americana.

I [wrote about hockey](http://web.archive.org/web/20140222055933/http://www.puckupdate.com/) for over a decade.

This site collects my work.
