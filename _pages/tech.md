I use Linux full-time at home and have for quite some time. I'm a believer in the power of free and open source software, and that belief fuels just about all of my technology writing.

My main technology writing outlet is [Linux Rig](https://linuxrig.com/), my site about using desktop Linux. A popular feature of that site is "[The Linux Setup](https://linuxrig.com/the-linux-setup/)," which is interviews with different Linux users about how they use Linux.

I've also written for [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/), which does a wonderful job covering free and open source technology and culture:

* [The rise of the shareable document](https://opensource.com/life/16/9/open-formats-academic-content)
* [4 open source tools I used to write a Linux book](https://opensource.com/life/16/7/open-source-tools-writing-book)
* [Writing documentation with AsciiDoc](https://opensource.com/life/15/10/asciidoc)
* [Just let your people do their jobs](https://opensource.com/open-organization/15/10/just-let-your-people-do-their-jobs)
* [Optimize your Linux rig for top-notch writing](https://opensource.com/life/14/8/trick-open-source-writing-keep-it-simple)
* [Scientists manage research with open source Zotero](https://opensource.com/life/14/6/managing-research-open-source-way-zotero)
* [Open education resources combat high textbook prices](https://opensource.com/education/14/4/open-education-resources-combat-high-textbook-prices)
* [3 open source markdown editors put to the test](https://opensource.com/14/3/markdown-editor-roundup)
* [How to write your book using Linux](https://opensource.com/life/13/11/how-write-book-with-linux)

I also occasionally post things to *Medium*:

* [Putting the Personal Back in Personal Computing](https://hackernoon.com/putting-the-personal-back-in-personal-computing-5c958ff0eae3)
* [Learning Linux with Tilde Clubs](https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/learning-linux-with-tilde-clubs-e4e9407c3e78)
* [The Joy of Linux Desktop Environments](https://hackernoon.com/the-joy-of-linux-desktop-environments-365d6cc8de72)
* [Learning Linux Through Immersion and Reflection](https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/learning-linux-through-immersion-and-reflection-fb7fd008467e)
* [Opening Linux Even Further](https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/opening-linux-even-further-13d2d6289ae0)
* [What Linux Taught Me About Productivity](https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/what-linux-taught-me-about-productivity-b7bc9f3511f2)

I also sometimes write about productivity. [These are the productivity articles from Linux Rig](https://linuxrig.com/category/hardly-working/). These are from other sites:

* [Four Steps to Creating a Personal Product Pipeline](https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/four-steps-to-creating-a-personal-product-pipeline-843d39a35b1) / *Medium*
* [Productivity is a Side Effect](https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/productivity-is-a-side-effect-a29d55f746) / *Medium*
* [Four Steps to Making the Most Out of Your Meeting Notes](https://timemanagementninja.com/2016/12/four-steps-to-making-the-most-out-of-your-meeting-notes/) / *Time Management Ninja*
* [Five Steps to Stage Your Project and Be More Productive](https://timemanagementninja.com/2016/08/5-steps-to-stage-your-project-and-be-more-productive/) / *Time Management Ninja*

I also wrote a few technical articles in support of my book, *[Learn Linux in a Month of Lunches](https://manning.com/ovadia)*:

* [How to Choose a Linux Desktop Environment](https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/131163-how-to-choose-a-linux-desktop-environment) / *Spiceworks*
